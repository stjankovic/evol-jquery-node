NAME
    gcloud config set - set a Cloud SDK property

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud config set SECTION/PROPERTY VALUE [--installation]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud config set sets the specified property in your active configuration
    only. A property governs the behavior of a specific aspect of Cloud SDK
    such as the service account to use or the verbosity level of logs. To set
    the property across all configurations, use the --installation flag. For
    more information regarding creating and using configurations, see gcloud
    topic configurations.

    To view a list of properties currently in use, run gcloud config list.

    To unset properties, use gcloud config unset.

    Note, Cloud SDK comes with a default configuration. To create multiple
    configurations, use gcloud config configurations create, and gcloud config
    configurations activate to switch between them.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SECTION/PROPERTY
        Property to be set. Note that SECTION/ is optional while referring to
        properties in the core section, i.e., using either core/project or
        project is a valid way of setting a project, while using section names
        is essential for setting specific properties like compute/region.
        Consult the Cloud SDK properties page for a comprehensive list of
        properties: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties

     VALUE
        Value to be set.

FLAGS
     --installation
        If set, the property is updated for the entire Cloud SDK installation.
        Otherwise, by default, the property is updated only in the currently
        active configuration.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

AVAILABLE PROPERTIES
     core
         account
            Account gcloud should use for authentication. Run gcloud auth list
            to see your currently available accounts.

         custom_ca_certs_file
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         default_regional_backend_service
            If True, backend services in gcloud compute backend-services will
            be regional by default. Setting the --global flag is required for
            global backend services.

         disable_color
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         disable_prompts
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            However, for any prompts that require user input, an error will be
            raised. This is equivalent to either using the global --quiet flag
            or setting the environment variable CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS
            to 1. Setting this property is useful when scripting with gcloud.

         disable_usage_reporting
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This value is set by default based on your choices during
            installation, but can be changed at any time. For more information,
            see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics

         log_http
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. To see logs
            in the terminal, adjust verbosity settings. Otherwise, logs are
            available in their respective log files.

         max_log_days
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, the default is 30 days.

         pass_credentials_to_gsutil
            If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.

         project
            Project ID of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default.
            This can be overridden by using the global --project flag.

         show_structured_logs
            Control when JSON-structured log messages for the current verbosity
            level (and above) will be written to standard error. If this
            property is disabled, logs are formatted as text by default.

            Valid values are:
            ì never - Log messages as text
            ì always - Always log messages as JSON
            ì log - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a file
            ì terminal - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a terminal

    If unset, default is never.

         trace_token
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         user_output_enabled
            True, by default. If False, messages to the user and command output
            on both standard output and standard error will be suppressed.

         verbosity
            Default logging verbosity for gcloud commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global --verbosity flag. Supported
            verbosity levels: debug, info, warning, error, and none.

     app
         cloud_build_timeout
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
            deployments. All Docker builds now use the Cloud Build API.

         promote_by_default
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version
            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. This
            property can be overridden via the --promote-by-default or
            --no-promote-by-default flags.

         stop_previous_version
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously
            deployed version is stopped. If False, older versions must be
            stopped manually.

         use_runtime_builders
            If set, opt in/out to a new code path for building applications
            using pre-fabricated runtimes that can be updated independently of
            client tooling. If not set, the default path for each runtime is
            used.

     auth
         disable_credentials
            If True, gcloud will not attempt to load any credentials or
            authenticate any requests. This is useful when behind a proxy that
            adds authentication to requests.

     billing
         quota_project
            Project that will be charged quota for the operations performed in
            gcloud. When unset, the default is [CURRENT_PROJECT]; this will
            charge quota against the currently set project for operations
            performed on it. Additionally, some existing APIs will continue to
            use a shared project for quota by default, when this property is
            unset.

            If you need to operate on one project, but need quota against a
            different project, you can use this property to specify the
            alternate project.

     builds
         timeout
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for builds to complete.

     component_manager
         additional_repositories
            Comma separated list of additional repositories to check for
            components. This property is automatically managed by the gcloud
            components repositories commands.

         disable_update_check
            If True, Cloud SDK will not automatically check for updates.

     composer
         location
            Composer location to use. Each Composer location constitutes an
            independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
            environments into Compute Engine regions inside this location. This
            parameter corresponds to the /locations/<location> segment of the
            Composer resource URIs being referenced.

     compute
         region
            Default region to use when working with regional Compute Engine
            resources. When a --region flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run gcloud compute regions list.

         use_new_list_usable_subnets_api
            If True,
